    "text": "What is Public Health?\n\n\n“Public health is the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organized efforts of society” - (Winslow 1920)\n\n\n“Public health is primarily concerned with the health of the entire population, rather than the health of individuals. Its features include an emphasis on the promotion of health and the prevention of disease and disability; the collection and use of epidemiological data, population surveillance, and other forms of empirical quantitative assessment; a recognition of the multidimensional nature of the determinants of health; and a focus on the complex interactions of many factors - biological, behavioral, social, and environmental - in developing effective interventions.” - (Childress et al. 2002)\n\nScoping review of definitions (Azari and Borisch 2023)"
